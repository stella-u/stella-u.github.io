                My name is Stella Ullman. I am currently an undergraduate student
                at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and a native daughter of Lexington,
                Kentucky. This website is a compilation of the coding
                and data analytics knowledge I continue to accumilate and the projects
                I have created along the way. I created my portfolio as a way to further
                develop my professional skills. Any feedback is deeply appreciated. 
                My contact information is available <i>here</i>. Thank you!
